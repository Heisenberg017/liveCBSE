                                Around 2006, Kota still had students coming to coachings for Competitive Examination,
                                but there was no authentic coaching for Board Exams. This resulted in the students
                                ending up achieving lower than their potential, in the Crucial Board Exams. Hence,
                                domain E was started.

                                domain E, founded in 2006, was started for Class XII Board Exam Preparation, catering to
                                the students preparing for Competitive Examinations at various institutes of Kota. Since
                                14 years of its inception, domain E has successfully registered more than 17000 students
                                for Class XII Board Exam Preparation alone. These include primarily offline (Kota
                                centre) and online students (Live Coaching via internet). Today domain E has become the
                                first choice of the students preparing for Board Exams. In past few years we have given
                                the best results including Zonal Toppers. The success can be owed to Professional
                                Management, Well Crafted Study Material, Dedicated Teachers and strong ethics for
                                Education.

                                <span class="about-span">Inception of Livecbse:</span> In the year 2014 we started with
                                live coaching with
                                real time
                                interactions via internet for CBSE Board Exam Preparation. Over these years we have
                                shown it has been as effective as our physical coaching. Many students have successfully
                                completed their course for the complete academic session and have also registered for
                                successive sessions. This has given us the confidence that we are on the right track and
                                can fill in the gap of lack of availability of competent teachers for other competitive
                                exams essentially based on NCERT.Hence proving the effectiveness of the model.
